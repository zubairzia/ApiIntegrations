What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) lets one system talk to another. It acts as a messenger or intermediary, taking a request from one system (the client), sending it to another system (the server) for processing, and then delivering the response back in a structured format. 
How APIs Work
The interaction between applications through an API is often explained using a client-server model, similar to a restaurant interaction: 
You (the client) place an order (a request) with the waiter.
The waiter (the API) takes your order to the kitchen.
The kitchen (the server) prepares the food (processes the request).
The waiter (the API) brings the food (the response) back to you. 
The API defines the "menu" (documentation) of what services are available, how to order them (endpoints and methods), and what the result will look like. 
Common Examples of APIs in Everyday Life
You interact with APIs constantly, often without realizing it: 
Logging in with Google or Facebook: When you use your social media credentials to log into a different website, an API is used to verify your identity with the service provider.
Checking the weather on your phone: Your weather app uses an API to fetch the latest data from a weather service's server.
Online payments: When you use PayPal or Stripe to pay on an e-commerce site, the website uses a payment gateway API to securely process the transaction without accessing your sensitive financial data.
Navigation apps: Ride-sharing or food delivery apps use mapping APIs (like Google Maps APIs for example) to provide directions, location tracking, and traffic information.
