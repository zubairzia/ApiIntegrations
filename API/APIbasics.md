What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) lets one system talk to another. It acts as a messenger or intermediary, taking a request from one system (the client), sending it to another system (the server) for processing, and then delivering the response back in a structured format. 
How APIs Work
The interaction between applications through an API is often explained using a client-server model, similar to a restaurant interaction: 
You (the client) place an order (a request) with the waiter.
The waiter (the API) takes your order to the kitchen.
The kitchen (the server) prepares the food (processes the request).
The waiter (the API) brings the food (the response) back to you. 
The API defines the "menu" (documentation) of what services are available, how to order them (endpoints and methods), and what the result will look like.
